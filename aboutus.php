                 <h3>Hi!</h3></br>
                 <p>We are a husband-and-wife team born and bred in Perth, WA with a passion for helping people and all things property. Our combined experience of 15+ years across property and customer service-based industries, puts us in a strong position when negotiating and purchasing property for our clients. We also have good relationships with <a href="https://www.dvbuyersagency.com.au/">real estate agents</a> and other various industry professionals that often plays a vital role in securing the right property for you. Daniel is also a fully qualified and licensed agent and a member of the Buyers Agent Institute (BAI).</p>
                 <div class="aboutSec"></div>
                 <p>We started <a href="https://www.dvbuyersagency.com.au/">DV Buyers Agency</a> after realising that too many buyers are misinformed and lack the required support when purchasing property. Sellers engage real estate agents to represent and guide them but buyers generally have no one. Our purpose is to fill that gap and provide an end-to-end service to make the buying journey easy and as stress free as possible for you. After all, buying a new property should be a positive experience!</p>

                        <li>Our key Sales Agent relationships and network is built on mutual trust and respect over time. Sometimes vital information about a property or vendor is shared with us, providing an advantage to secure the property on more favourable terms.</li><br>
                        <li>Insights on capital growth rates, rental yields, vacancy rates, planned infrastructure etc.. Conducted via use of free and advanced research tools.</li><br>
                        <li>Having a third party negotiate and purchase a property on your behalf ensures you don’t overpay as the emotion is removed.</li><br>
                        <li>Avoid uncomfortable situations with pushy sales agents. We are well rehearsed in the art of negotiating and can combine data, skills and experience to achieve the best outcome/deal for you.</li>
